                In this process, the dentist uses a tooth-coloured resin that slightly matches your teeth. The surface
                of the tooth is cleaned and a conditioning liquid is applied to the tooth, which helps the bonding
                material stick to the tooth and he will adjust the material correctly into the gap and smoothen the
                shape of the tooth. After this process, the dentist will use a light that covers resin with a harder
                substance that matches your teeth, and finally, the dentist will clean the surface of the teeth and
                reshape the teeth. This procedure takes 40-60 minutes.
